## Project Overview

This project applies Association Rule Mining using the Apriori algorithm in R to analyze transactional recipe data.

The objective is to discover frequent itemsets and strong association rules based on support, confidence, and lift.

## Dataset Information

- Total transactions: 6,750
- Unique items: 29
- Average items per transaction: 5.39

---

## Methods Used

- Frequent 1-itemsets, 2-itemsets, 3-itemsets
- Apriori algorithm
- Support, Confidence, Lift metrics
- Rule visualization:
  - Graph plot
  - Scatter plot
  - Matrix plot

---

## Key Findings

Top frequent items:
- Onion
- Garlic
- Tomato

Strongest Rule:
Garlic & Onion → Tomato  
Confidence: 0.897  
Lift: 2.77
